Hello my name is Zaid
What I do in this project is an attempt to analyze AIRBNB data to come up with useful statistics and comparisons in Seattle and Boston, 
and it is often said that a data scientist must know how to ask questions according to the data available to him to reach important and useful results, in this project I asked 3 important questions, namely:
1- What is the average price of each type of real estate in Seattle vs. Boston?
2- What is the average rating for each property type in Seattle versus Posen?

3- Then he posed the third question, how can we understand the price expectation?

With these three questions I can mediate important and beneficial results
